Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install {{ package.name }} --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('{{ package.name }}');
```
