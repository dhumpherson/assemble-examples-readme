## Tips
**Sublime Text Syntax Highlighting**

You will notice that the partials in this example have the extension `.md.hbs`, this isn't really necessary for the task to work, but it makes it more obvious that we're using `markdown` templates. The downside is that you lose syntax highlighting for markdown when you add the `.hbs` extension. If you use Sublime Text 2, here is how to fix that:

Go to **preferences**, and then **browse packages** and search for a file named `Markdown.tmLanguage`. Near the top of the file you will find a list of `fileTypes` (really just their extensions):

``` xml
  <array>
    <string>mdown</string>
    <string>markdown</string>
    <string>markdn</string>
    <string>md</string>
  </array>
```

Add `<string>md.hbs</string>` to the list, just below `markdn`, and then save. Syntax highlighting for markdown should now be working for all files with the extension `.md.hbs`.
